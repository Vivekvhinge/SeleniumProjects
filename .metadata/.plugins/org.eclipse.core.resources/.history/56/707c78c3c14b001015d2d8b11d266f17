in feature file :
scenario outline  instead of scenario 
eg : Scenario outline : Successful login with valid credentials
 & instead of hardcode data  like :And user enters email as "admin@yourstore.com" and password as "admin"
USE : And user enters email as "<email>" and password as "<PASSWORD>" .[so we can store multiple data .]
then in Examples : write the data set 
|email|password|
| admin@yourstore.com|admin|  <---like this ,and if u have eneter 4 data then it will execute it by 4 times


Session#2
---------
Data Driven Testing
	Scenario outline keyword
	Examples:
Generated Reports in HTML, JSON & XML format
Added new feature file (Add new customer)
	Created feature file (customers.feature)
	Added test steps in Gherkin language
	Created page object class for add new customer page
	created step definition for customers.feature file 
	Executed test script (customers.feature) using test 	runner file (run.java)
	
Session#3
Added new scenarios in customers.feature file
Scenario: Search customer by email
Scenario: Search customer by name
Background keyword: for common / repeating steps in scenarios  mention this in feature file below feature:

eg :
Background:steps common for all scenario
	Given User launch chrome browser
    When User open URL: "https://admin-demo.nopcommerce.com/login"
    And user enters email as "admin@yourstore.com" and password as "admin"
    And click on login
    Then User can view Dashboad
    
    
    

Session#4
A)Base class: is created in step defn file to maintain the common methods & variable .
& extend the step den file means base class will be parent class and step defn file will be child class

//create a class in baseclass for emailid so  it will create unique email id so every time we don't have to hardcoded for new mail 
	public String generatemailid()
	{
		return (RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic(5)); //RandomStringUtils to generate random strings &randomAlphabetic for alphabet length
	}
	
B)Executing multiple feature files  or stepdefintion : in testrunnerclass
1.multiple :to run it just remove file name after feature folder:
eg : features = "src/test/resources/Features",
2.in that u can select a single feature file to run 
eg : features = "src/test/resources/Features/LoginFeature.feature",
3.to run specific feature files 
eg : features = {"src/test/resources/Features/LoginFeature.feature","src/test/resources/Features/Customer.feature"},

C)@Tags (or, and & and not operator).: 
* You put `@something` (like `@smoke` or `@regression`) above a test in your feature file.
* Then, in your `TestRunner` file, you tell Cucumber which groups (`@smoke`, `@regression`, etc.) you want to run.
* You can use `and`, `or`, `not` to combine these groups.
When defining the tags attribute in your @CucumberOptions in TestRunner.java, you use logical operators to specify which scenarios to run:

tags = "@Sanity": This will run any scenario that is tagged with @Sanity. It will execute even if the scenario also has other tags.

tags = "@Sanity or @Regression": This will run any scenario that is tagged with either @Sanity OR @Regression (or both).

tags = "@Sanity and @Regression": This will run only those scenarios that are tagged with both @Sanity AND @Regression. it will not run like "Or" tag		

tags = "@Sanity and not @Regression": This will run scenarios that are tagged with @Sanity but are not also tagged with @Regression.

* This is super useful if you only want to run a quick set of "sanity" tests, or all "regression" tests, instead of running everything.










Session#5
Types of hooks
Scenario hook: @Before //executed before start of each scenario execution & @After //executed after completion of each scenario execution
Step Hooks:
@Beforestep //executed before each step execution
@Afterstep //is executed before after each step execution
Conditional hook: @Before("@Sanity")
How to capture screen shot screen shot of failed test scenarios 
Hooks  [in step definition class] similar to TESTNG LISTERNERS 
Hooks are block of code that runs before and after each scenario.
type of hooks in cucumber:
1. Scenario hooks: runs before/after each scenario.
@Before Annotation //steps to performs before start of testing of each scenario & can give multiple before(order=0) like this. 0 ascending order small to big
Setup code:
To Start a web driver
Set up of Data Base connections
Set up of test data
Set up of browser cookies
Navigation to a certain page

@After Annotation //steps to perform after testing of each scenario & can give multiple after(order=0) like this. 0 descending order big to small
Cleanup/code teardown:
To stop the web driver
To Close DB connections
To Clear the test data
To Clear browser cookies
To Log out from the application
Printing reports or logs
Taking the screenshots of error


2.Step Hooks: These run before or after each individual step.
3.Conditional Hooks: These allow you to associate hooks with tags for conditional execution, meaning they only run if the associated scenario 
or feature has a specific tag.
syntax :before("@sanity") ,@sanity from feature file

4.how to take failed SS in stepdefn file
create class scenario in parameter of Scenario 
eg:@After
	public void teardown(Scenario sc)
	now write the same code for taking ss
	
	
	
Session#6
Logger integration in eclipse
Apache-Log4j 2

log4j2: or refer to package log4j
first give dependency in poml file
second In Base class create logger object ie.public static Logger log; & import org.apache.logging.log4j.*;

third in stepdefn file instantiate it ie.log=Logmanager.getlogger("stepdefn"); 
logmanager import must be "import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;"

change/give  class name in log4j2.properties file
ie.logger.file.name=Stepdef //class name to be rename    

write message below drivermanger
ie :log.info("log setup method is executed ....."); <---give this where you want the logs for methods 
LOG LEVELS:
		https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/customloglevels.html


Session-7:
1.Run test cases / feature file on specific browser
2.configurtion.properties :write parameters or values in keyvaluepair and variables too, no special char to end 
eg :key[variable]=value
browser=chrome

3.read properties : use properties class to instantiate [after config is done]
create obj of properties in base class and instantiate in step defn class like below:
now create obj of fileinputstream for readonly mode to open of readconfig/configproperties file
			FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("config.properties");//file name given cz in same project not in folder or give filepath
			readconfig.load(fis); //to load the fis object 
create string obj to store the readconfigs .getproperties variable value[stored in config.properties]
string browser=readconfig.getproperties("name of key[variable]");

create a class readconfig in utilities 



Session#8:
Execute test case using pom.xml within eclipse:

step1:add this plugin to pom.xml file
<pluginManagement>
    <!-- lock down plugins versions to avoid using Maven defaults (may be moved to parent pom) -->
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>   //add this plugin for maven  repo
            <version>3.0.0-M7</version>
            <configuration>
                <!-- Set to true to allow the build to continue even if tests fail -->
                <testFailureIgnore>true</testFailureIgnore>
                <!-- Include specific test runner classes by pattern -->
                <includes>
                    <!-- This will include any Java files ending with 'Run.java' for execution -->
                    <include>**/*TestRunner.java</include>                        //you can testrunner or run file name the file 
                </includes>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</pluginManagement>

after saving update this maven project and on Pom.xml<run as<maven test [to execute]

         
         
         
                    

Execute test case outside eclipse using maven (a build tool)
a) Command Line Interface (CLI)
b) Batch file
c) Jenkins
