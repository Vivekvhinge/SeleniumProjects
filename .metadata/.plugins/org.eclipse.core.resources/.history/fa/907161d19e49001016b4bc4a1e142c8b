in feature file :
scenario outline  instead of scenario 
eg : Scenario outline : Successful login with valid credentials
 & instead of hardcode data  like :And user enters email as "admin@yourstore.com" and password as "admin"
USE : And user enters email as "<email>" and password as "<PASSWORD>" .[so we can store multiple data .]
then in Examples : write the data set 
|email|password|
| admin@yourstore.com|admin|  <---like this ,and if u have eneter 4 data then it will execute it by 4 times

Session#3
Added new scenarios in customers.feature file
Scenario: Search customer by email
Scenario: Search customer by name
Background keyword: for common / repeating steps in scenarios

Session#4
Base class: is created in step defn file to maintain the common methods & variable .
& extend the step den file means base class will be parent class and step defn file will be child class

//create a class in baseclass for emailid so  it will create unique email id so every time we don't have to hardcoded for new mail 
	public String generatemailid()
	{
		return (RandomStringUtils.randomAlphabetic(5)); //RandomStringUtils to generate random strings &randomAlphabetic for alphabet length
	}
